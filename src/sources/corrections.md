# Sources Corrections

This file stores rules for normalizing and correcting text during the ingest-to-sources transformation. Add entries here when the agent is corrected on how raw text from `ingest/` should be represented in `sources/` Markdown.

Format: concise “Do X” / “Don’t Y” / “When Z, do W”.

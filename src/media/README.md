# Media Library

Shared, top-level library for binary media assets (images, videos, audio, etc.). Each media item should reside in its own subfolder named `YYYY-MM-DD_short_descriptive_name/` and include a `meta.md` file describing its provenance, content, and relevant metadata. Markdown files throughout the repo can link to these assets.

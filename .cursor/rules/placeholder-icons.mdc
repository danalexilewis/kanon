# Placeholder icons

- **Do not** add made-up or fake icon files (e.g. `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`) that don't exist in the repo.
- When you need to stub out placeholder icons, use the **`placeholder`** package:

  ```bash
  pnpm add placeholder
  ```

  Use it to generate or reference placeholder assets; add real icon files when you have them.

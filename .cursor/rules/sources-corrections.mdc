# Sources Corrections Rules

This rule defines `src/sources/corrections.md` as the store for normalization and correction rules applied during the `ingest` and `ingest-force` skill execution, specifically when transforming raw ingest files into `src/sources/` Markdown.

- **Store**: Maintain a store of learnings and corrections in `src/sources/corrections.md`. When the agent is corrected on how raw text from `src/ingest/` should be normalized or represented in `src/sources/`, add a short, actionable entry here.
- **Application**: The agent must read `src/sources/corrections.md` and apply these rules before writing any content to `src/sources/`.
- **Format**: Entries should be concise: “Do X” / “Don’t Y” / “When Z, do W”. Examples include consistent speaker names, common transcription misspellings (e.g., `mispeled -> misspelled`), canonical organization names, or preferred terminology for entities.

*(Example entry: `Always spell 'Kanon' with a capital K`)*

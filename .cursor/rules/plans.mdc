# Plans

- **Historical copy:** Whenever you create or finalize a plan (e.g. via the plan tool or a plan document), also add a copy to the **`./plan/`** folder for historical reference.
- Use a stable, descriptive filename (e.g. `plan-name_short-id.plan.md` or `plan-name_YYYY-MM-DD.plan.md`) so past plans are easy to find and don’t overwrite each other.

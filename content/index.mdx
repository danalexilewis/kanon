# Knowledge base

This site is built from the **Fumadocs content folder** (`content/`). Content is generated by processing files in `ingest/` according to the schema in `ontology/`.

- **Docs** — Topic and reference docs.
- **Entities** — One file per entity; stable identifiers, provenance, and optional confidence.
- **Events** — One file per event; same conventions.

Every page under `content/` is traceable to ingest via frontmatter or a **Sources** section.

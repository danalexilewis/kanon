# Waiting for ontology to be created

This site is generated from your **sources** and **ontology**. Until you run the pipeline, there’s nothing to show yet.

## How to get started

1. **Import files into `src/references/`**  
   Add PDFs, docs, or other reference material that describes how you want your knowledge base structured.

2. **Create your ontology**  
   Run the **`create-ontology`** skill (using `src/references/` and a short prompt) to define entity types, events, and how they map to the docs. The schema is saved in `.cursor/rules/ontology.mdc`.

3. **Add files to `src/ingest/`**  
   Drop raw material here: transcripts, notes, meeting dumps, etc. Append only—don’t edit files after adding.

4. **Run the `ingest` skill**  
   Process everything in `src/ingest/` into normalized Markdown in `src/sources/` and media in `src/media/`. Manifests in `src/ingest/` are updated automatically.

5. **Run the `update-docs` skill**  
   Generate (or refresh) the published docs in `content/` from `src/sources/` and the ontology. The site will then show your knowledge base.

After that, the **/docs** section of this site will reflect your content. Re-run **`ingest`** when you add new raw files, and **`update-docs`** when you change sources or the ontology.

# Entities

One file per entity. Include `source_ingest` (or `sources`) in frontmatter and a **Sources** section. Use a **stable identifier** (slug) as the filename; when the same entity appears in multiple ingest files, merge into this one file and add the new source to provenance. No duplicate entity files.

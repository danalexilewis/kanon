# Advanced guide

<Callout type="info" title="Quick reference only">
**Check the [official Fumadocs UI components docs](https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs/ui/components#overview) for the most up-to-date information.** This page is a quick reference for common patterns used in this project.
</Callout>

This page covers **Fumadocs-specific** features you can use in MDX under `content/`. They’re available in generated docs and in any `.mdx` file in `content/`. Each section shows the **output** first, then the **code** that produces it.

For standard Markdown (GFM), see the [Markdown guide](/docs/markdown-guide).

---

Callouts (tips, warnings, notes with types like `info`, `warn`, `error`, `success`, `idea`) are documented in the [Markdown guide](/docs/guides/markdown-guide).

---

## Cards

**Source:** [Fumadocs UI — MDX Components](https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs/ui/components#mdx-components)

Cards are useful for “Further reading,” “Related pages,” or a set of links with titles and short descriptions.

**Output:** (example with one card)

<Cards>
  <Card href="https://eddy.works" title="eddy.works">
    Tools and support.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/docs/markdown-guide" title="Markdown guide">
    GFM syntax and when to use what.
  </Card>
</Cards>

```mdx
<Cards>
  <Card href="https://eddy.works" title="eddy.works">
    Tools and support.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/docs/markdown-guide" title="Markdown guide">
    GFM syntax and when to use what.
  </Card>
</Cards>
```

<Callout type="info" title="When to use">
Use Cards at the end of a doc for “See also” or “Next steps.” You can omit `href` for a card that’s not a link (e.g. a short note).
</Callout>

## Code blocks

Use fenced code blocks with three backticks. Add a language name for syntax highlighting (e.g. `txt`, `md`, `json`, `bash`, `ts`, `tsx`). You can add a **title** with `title="My Title"`. For **tab groups**, use `tab="Tab 1"` and `tab="Tab 2"` (etc.) on consecutive code blocks to show them in tabs. Fumadocs uses Shiki (Rehype Code) for highlighting.

**Output:**

```txt title="Example"
Hello from a code block.
Use ``` on its own line above and below.
```

````mdx
```txt title="Example"
Hello from a code block.
Use ``` on its own line above and below.
```
````

---

## Code blocks: line numbers and language

**Source:** [Fumadocs UI — MDX Components](https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs/ui/components#mdx-components)

You can turn on line numbers and set the starting number.

**Output:**

```js lineNumbers lineNumbers=4
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello');
  return 0;
}
```

````mdx
```js lineNumbers lineNumbers=4
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello');
  return 0;
}
```
````

- `lineNumbers` — show line numbers.
- `lineNumbers=4` — start numbering at 4 (optional).

<Callout type="info" title="Language">
Use a language id after the opening backticks: `js`, `ts`, `json`, `bash`, `md`, `txt`, etc. Shiki supports many languages.
</Callout>

---

## Code blocks: highlighting and focus

**Source:** [Fumadocs UI — MDX Components](https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs/ui/components#mdx-components)

You can highlight specific lines or words, or show a “diff” style (add/remove). Useful for tutorials.

**Output:**

```tsx
// This line is highlighted
<div>Hello</div> // [!code highlight]
// This word is highlighted: Fumadocs // [!code word:Fumadocs]
```

(If your theme supports it, you’ll see the highlight on the marked lines.)

````mdx
```tsx
// This line is highlighted
<div>Hello</div> // [!code highlight]
// This word is highlighted: Fumadocs // [!code word:Fumadocs]
```
````

Other Shiki-style comments (when supported):

- `// [!code highlight]` — highlight the line
- `// [!code word:Something]` — highlight the word “Something”
- `// [!code --]` — show as removed (red)
- `// [!code ++]` — show as added (green)
- `// [!code focus]` — focus (dim others)

<Callout type="warn" title="Theme support">
Highlight/diff/focus depend on your Fumadocs theme and Shiki setup. If you don’t see the effect, the theme may not enable it.
</Callout>

## Headings: TOC and custom anchors

**Source:** [Fumadocs UI — MDX Components](https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs/ui/components#mdx-components)

Headings get automatic anchors (e.g. `#heading-title`). You can hide a heading from the table of contents or give it a custom anchor.

**Hide from TOC:** add `[!toc]` (hidden from TOC) or `[toc]` (only in TOC, not rendered as a big heading). Useful for grouping TOC entries without extra on-page headings.

**Custom anchor:** add `[#my-slug]` so the heading links to `#my-slug`.

```md
# My section [#my-section]

## This heading is hidden from TOC [!toc]
```

Link to it: `/docs/your-page#my-section`. See [Fumadocs Markdown](https://fumadocs.dev/docs/markdown) for full details.

---

## Embed content from another file

In Fumadocs MDX you can pull in another file (Markdown or MDX) with the `<include>` tag. The path is relative to the current file.

```mdx
<include>./another.mdx</include>
```

See [Fumadocs Include](https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs/mdx/include) for other usages.

---

## NPM commands

Use a `npm`-tagged code block to show the same install command for multiple package managers (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun). Fumadocs turns it into tabbed commands.

````md
```npm
npm i next -D
```
````

See [Fumadocs remark-npm](https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs/headless/mdx/remark-npm) for options.

---

## Custom Components

**Source:** [Fumadocs UI — Components overview](https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs/ui/components#overview) (Fumadocs ships Cards, Callouts, Code Blocks, Headings; this project adds the components below.)

We’ve added some custom MDX components to make authoring more like Notion/Obsidian. These are available in any MDX file in `content/` and are styled to match the Fumadocs theme.

### Collapsible (Custom)

**Source:** Project component — `components/mdx/collapsible.tsx`

A simple toggle block to hide and show content. Great for FAQs or optional details.

**Output:**

<Collapsible title="Click to expand">
This content is hidden by default and expands on click.
</Collapsible>

```mdx
<Collapsible title="Click to expand">
This content is hidden by default and expands on click.
</Collapsible>
```

- `title`: The text displayed on the toggle (can be Markdown/MDX).
- `defaultOpen`: `true` or `false` (defaults to `false`).

### Badge (Custom)

**Source:** Project component — `components/mdx/badge.tsx`

Small labels for highlighting status, categories, or keywords.

**Output:**

<Badge variant="success">New</Badge> <Badge variant="warning">Beta</Badge> <Badge variant="danger">Deprecated</Badge>

```mdx
<Badge variant="success">New</Badge> <Badge variant="warning">Beta</Badge> <Badge variant="danger">Deprecated</Badge>
```

- `variant`: `default` | `secondary` | `success` | `warning` | `danger`

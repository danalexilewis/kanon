# Sources - Media

Markdown files providing metadata and notes for media assets. Each file should have standard frontmatter (id, source_type, weight, title, created_at, ingest_paths, ingest_hashes) and may include optional fields like people, orgs, tags, language, confidence, needs_review, media_refs. These files should reference actual binary media stored in the top-level `media/` folder.
